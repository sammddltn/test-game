# Super Cubicle Adventure

# using Unity version 2019.2.0f1

-possible issues:

1. maybe make a dotted line from the cursor to the player so making shots is easier?

2. the raycast currently collides with a plane underneath the map, making it collide with a plane created on the y axis of the player would mean we could have controls working even if the camera angle changed.
